Completed this project under 3hr. Since the api From newsapi.org is free I am not getting complete data for content field. I have tried my best to meet all the requirement. In the detail screen if you click on the title which is placed on the top of the image it will open the related news on the browser. For some news there were no image so I have used a default image url for those images. Will work on both android and iOS

Thank you.
